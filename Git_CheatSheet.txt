======Committing changes to repo in git (L5,26)============
Adding your changes

# home directory
$ pwd                          
$ cd git-fast
$ ls
$ cd myRepoFromScratch
$ ls

# create a file and add some content
$ vi demoFile1                    
$ cat demoFile1
$ git status
$ git add demoFile1
$ git rm --cached demoFile1
$ git status



Committing changes

 # home directory
$ pwd                              
$ git status
$ git add demofile1
$ git status
$ git commit -m "our first commit in this course"
$ git status



Command Summary - add and commit

$ git add
$ git commit -m "message goes here"
====================================

git status  ==> to know the status of the workspace like checked out files & other private files including the git repo files
git log ==> to know the commit history synced in to workspace from 
git status --long ==> same as "git status"  which is by default long/detailed
git status -s ==> short representation


git log --oneline
git log -n <recent past number>
git log <since> <until>  (since/until can be commit id's or branch names)

How to check your repo status

# cd to /c/Users/HP-PC/git-fast/myRepoFromScratch
$ pwd
$ ls

# start with a clean working directory
$ git status                

# create file and add some contents such as "I want to shed 15 kg 5 weeks"        
$ vi weightLossChart    

# create file and add some contents such as "I want to add more green vegetables to my diet"    
$ vi dietChart                  
$ git status           

 # same as "git status" since "long" option is the default one (compare output)    
$ git status --long        
$ git status -s                                 # status "??" for untracked file
$ git add weightLossChart
$ git status -s                                 # status "A"
$ git commit -m "1st commit for weightLossChart"
$ git status -s     
$ vi weightLossChart                 # make some changes to the file
$ git status -s                              # status "M"
$ git add weightLossChart  
$ git status -s                                # status "M"
$ git commit -m "2nd commit for weightLossChart"
$ git status -s   
$ mv weightLossChart weightLossChart2
$ git status -s                             # status "D"



How to check commit history

# displays the entire commit history using the default formatting
$ git log                

# oneline condensed view of each commit history                      
$ git log --oneline

# Only display commits that include the specified file                             
$ git log <file>          

# Show only commits that occur between <since> and <until>. Both arguments can be either a commit ID ...contd. 
# a branch, name, HEAD, or any other kind of revision reference.                    
$ git log <since>..<until>                     

# Limit the number of commits by <limit>. For example, git log -n 3 will display only 3 commits.  
$ git log -n <limit>                          



Command Summary - status & log

# provides a status report of the repo
$ git status             

# displays the entire commit history using the default formatting                       
$ git log                

 # oneline condensed view of each commit history                      
$ git log --oneline           

# Only display commits that include the specified file                 
$ git log <file>     

# Show only commits that occur between <since> and <until>. Both arguments can be either a commit ID, a branch
# name, HEAD, or any other kind of revision reference.                        
$ git log <since>..<until>                    

# Limit the number of commits by <limit>. For example, git log -n 3 will display only 3 commits. 
$ git log -n <limit>
